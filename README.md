# Graduation-project--Fine-Tuning-Bert-for-ABSA-task-in-Vietnamese
This is my Graduation project. 
In the project, i had used two pre-trained Bert is "bertbase-multilingual-cased", PhoBERT for tuning. 
ABSA task has two Phase:
+ Phase A: Aspect Detection
+ Phase B: Aspect Polarity
Both was used a mimilar model and setting is Single Sentence Classification.

Besides, I also develop and build more terminal models for ABSA tasks. This task consists of two phases:
+ Phase 1: Aspect Detection: identify aspect#attribute pairs in the review. I use the same  model in Phase A
+ Phase 2: Bert Polarity: Labeling polar emotions for the aspect#attribute with three polarity: positive, negative, neutral.
I use model: Sentence pair classification.
